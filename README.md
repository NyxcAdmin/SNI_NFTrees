# SNI_NFTrees
In collaboration with the Sovereign Nature Initiative Sādu app users will be able to acquire NFTrees, or a digital representation of a living tree that is physically mapped within a green space. The NFTree is linked to a living tree with a QR code. Visitors to the green space can see the NFTree by scanning a QR code displayed on the physical tree and opening an augmented reality application. Any one who interacts with the avatar will be able to see who's collection the NFTree resides in via the Sādu app.
